## Introduction
The Java-based banking system aims to manage essential banking operations, including customer account management, transactions, and balance inquiries. The system will provide a secure, user-friendly console interface for both customers and bank administrators.

### A. Functional Requirements
1. Customer Account Management
-Account Creation:
Users should be able to create new accounts by providing necessary personal details (name, address, phone number, etc.).
Each new account should have a unique account number generated by the system.
An initial deposit amount must be specified during account creation.

- Account Information Management:
Users should be able to view their account details by entering their account number.
Administrators should be able to update customer information as needed.
The system should support the deletion of accounts.

2. Transaction Management
- Deposits:
Users should be able to deposit money into their accounts by specifying the account number and deposit amount.
The system should update the account balance accordingly.

- Withdrawals:
Users should be able to withdraw money from their accounts by specifying the account number and withdrawal amount.
The system should check for sufficient balance before processing the withdrawal.

- Money Transfers:
Users should be able to transfer money between accounts within the bank.
The system should handle transfers by verifying both accounts and updating their balances accordingly.

3. Balance Inquiry
- Check Balance:
Users should be able to check the current balance of their account by providing their account number.

### B. Non-Functional Requirements
1. Security
Implement authentication mechanisms to ensure only authorized users can access and manage accounts.
Encrypt sensitive data, such as account numbers and personal information, to protect against unauthorized access.
Implement audit logs to track user actions and transactions for security and compliance purposes.

2. Performance
The system should handle multiple users and transactions efficiently, ensuring quick response times for all operations.
Optimize data structures and algorithms to maintain high performance, even as the number of accounts and transactions grows.

3. Usability
The console interface should be intuitive and easy to navigate for both customers and administrators.
Provide clear prompts and messages to guide users through various operations.
Ensure consistent and user-friendly error handling.

4. Reliability and Availability
The system should be reliable, ensuring data consistency and accuracy across all operations.
Implement backup and recovery mechanisms to protect against data loss.
Ensure high availability of the system to minimize downtime.

### C. Technical Requirements
**Programming Language**: Java SE 8 or higher.

**Data Storage**: In-memory data structures (e.g., lists, maps) for initial development; consider a database for long-term storage.

**Interface**: Console-based user interface for user interactions.

**Development Environment**: Compatible with standard Java development tools (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).

**Constraints**
- No external libraries are allowed, except for standard Java libraries.
- The application must be developed and tested using Java SE 8 or higher.
